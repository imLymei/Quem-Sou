# Beginner college project about our selfs

I programmed this with my friends as a college project talking about us using basic/intermediate HMTML5 and CSS3 with correct syntax.
We split the work, so the code is a bit confusing.

## How to run?

Just open index.html and you will get to the hub layout, from there you can see the project question and the respective links for each profile.
